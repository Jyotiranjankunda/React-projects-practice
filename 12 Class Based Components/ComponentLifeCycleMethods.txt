side effects are handled by life cycle methods in class based components.
In functional component, these are done by useEffect hook.
Class based components can't use hooks.

1. componentDidMount() => called once a component mounted (evaluated and rendered by react)
It is similar to useEffect(..., [])

2. componentDidUpdate() => called once a component updated (re-evaluated and re-rendered by react)
It is similart to useEffect(..., [someValue])

3. componentWillUnmount() => called right before component is unmounted (evaluated right before removed from DOM)
It is similar to the clean up function in useEffect, which runs right before the component is removed.
useEffect(() => {
  return () => {...}
}, [])
